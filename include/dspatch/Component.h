/// Abstract base class for DSPatch components

/**
Classes derived from Component can be added to a Circuit and routed to and from other Components.

On construction, derived classes must configure the component's IO buses by calling
SetInputCount_() and SetOutputCount_() respectively.

Derived classes must also implement the virtual method: Process_(). The Process_() method is a
callback from the DSPatch engine that occurs when a new set of input signals is ready for
processing. The Process_() method has 2 arguments: the input bus, and the output bus. This method's
purpose is to pull its required inputs out of the input bus, process these inputs, and populate the
output bus with the results (see SignalBus).

In order for a component to do any work it must be ticked. This is performed by repeatedly calling
the Tick() and Reset() methods. The Tick() method is responsible for acquiring the next set of
input signals from component input wires and populating the component's input bus. To insure that
these inputs are up-to-date, the dependent component first calls all of its input components'
Tick() methods - hence recursively called in all components going backward through the circuit. The
acquired input bus is then passed to the Process_() method. The Reset() method informs the
component that the last circuit traversal has completed and hence can execute the next Tick()
request.
