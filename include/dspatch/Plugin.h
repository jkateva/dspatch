/// Component plugin loader

/**
A component, packaged into a shared library (.so / .dylib / .dll) and exported via the
EXPORT_PLUGIN macro, can be dynamically loaded into a host application using the Plugin class. Each
Plugin object represents one Component class.

A Plugin should be constructed with the absolute path of the plugin (shared library) to be loaded.
Once instantiated you should check that the plugin was successfully loaded by calling IsLoaded().
Thereafter, the contained component type can be instantiated (mutiple times) via the Create()
method.
